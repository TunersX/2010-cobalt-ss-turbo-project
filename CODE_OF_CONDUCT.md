# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors and maintainers of this documentation project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, technical background, race, gender, or any other characteristic.  We value respectful communication, constructive feedback and a shared commitment to safety when working on the 2010 Cobalt SS.

## Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Sharing knowledge and test results transparently.
- Focusing on vehicle safety and responsible tuning practices.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Personal attacks or trolling.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Advocating or encouraging unsafe mechanical practices.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project maintainer directly.  We will review and investigate all complaints and will respond in a way that is deemed appropriate to the circumstances.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
