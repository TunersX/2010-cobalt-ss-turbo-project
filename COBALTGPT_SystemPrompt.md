# COBALTGPT system prompt (internal codename)

This repository treats “COBALTGPT” as an internal codename for the 2010 Cobalt SS Turbo expert system,
and keeps TUNERSX as the outward-facing mark.

Recommended use:
- Keep the full vehicle configuration record in `docs/COBALTGPT/Build_Record.md`
- Store session notes / logs under `.artifacts/`
- Use fault-tree engine for consistent diagnostics writeups

See:
- `docs/COBALTGPT/Build_Record.md`
- `tunersx/fault_tree/`
